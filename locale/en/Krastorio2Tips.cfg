kr-air-purifier=The [entity=kr-air-purifier] is a building that purifies the atmosphere near it by consuming a [item=pollution-filter].\n\nThe game map is divided into 32x32 areas called chunks, and each of them contains a certain amount of pollution. The purifier [color=red]will only purify the chunk where it is placed[/color], and will keep doing it even after the chunk has been completely cleaned.\n\nTo see chunks on the map, you can use mods or the Factorio debug view, accessible using __CONTROL__debug-toggle-debug-settings__.\n\nOnce the purifier has consumed a filter, there is a [color=orange]90% probability[/color] that you will get back a [item=used-pollution-filter] that can be cleaned to use again.\n\nYou can see how much pollution is purified from the production statistics panel (__CONTROL__production-statistics__). The consumed amount equals the purified amount.
